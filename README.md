## About this game

A fishing game made in Pygame

This was my final project for the grade 10 computer science course

## Guide

When you first play the game, you will be on the main fish island.

On this island, you will be doing all of your fishing. To start fishing, go to the edge of the island and then press “F” on your keyboard and a minigame will appear in front of you. Once complete you’ll receive a fish at random which can sold in the market island.

To go to the market island, you will need to go up the path and press “T”.

To sell your caught fish, you will need to enter the house where a fish market popup should appear.

To sell, press the “Sell” button at the bottom of the pop-up.

Once you have earned enough money, you can go to the shop market where new fishing rods and baits can be bought to increase the chance of catching a more expensive and rare fish.

To purchase new fishing rods, go to the shop on the right.
To purchase new baits, go to the shop on the left.
